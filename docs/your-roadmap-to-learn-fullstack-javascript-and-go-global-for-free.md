## ‚úçÔ∏è Final Tips

* Focus on **one stack**, and go deep. For most aspiring remote devs, JavaScript + TypeScript is enough.
* **Document your journey**‚ÄîREADME files, GitHub commits, even blog posts.
* Practice both technical and soft skills. Remote jobs need independent thinkers who communicate well.
