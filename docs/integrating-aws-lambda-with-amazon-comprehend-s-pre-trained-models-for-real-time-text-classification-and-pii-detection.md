#### **Step 2: Develop the AWS Lambda Function**

We'll use **Node.js** for the Lambda function code.

**Code for AWS Lambda Function:**

```javascript
// index.js

const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const comprehend = new AWS.Comprehend();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
    try {
        // Extract text from the event
        const text = event.text;
        const languageCode = 'en'; // Adjust if necessary

        // PII Detection
        const piiParams = {
            Text: text,
            LanguageCode: languageCode
        };
        const piiData = await comprehend.detectPiiEntities(piiParams).promise();

        // Extract PII entities
        const piiEntities = piiData.Entities;

        // Text Classification (Sentiment Analysis as an example)
        const sentimentParams = {
            Text: text,
            LanguageCode: languageCode
        };
        const sentimentData = await comprehend.detectSentiment(sentimentParams).promise();

        // Extract sentiment
        const sentiment = sentimentData.Sentiment;

        // Key Phrases Extraction
        const keyPhrasesParams = {
            Text: text,
            LanguageCode: languageCode
        };
        const keyPhrasesData = await comprehend.detectKeyPhrases(keyPhrasesParams).promise();

        // Prepare the response
        const response = {
            statusCode: 200,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                sentiment: sentiment,
                piiEntities: piiEntities,
                keyPhrases: keyPhrasesData.KeyPhrases
            }),
        };
        return response;
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
        return {
            statusCode: 500,
            body: JSON.stringify({
                error: 'Error processing the text.'
            }),
        };
    }
};
```

**Notes:**

- **LanguageCode**: Adjust `'en'` if you're processing text in other languages.

### **4. Extending the Functionality**

#### **Adding Language Detection**

- Use `comprehend.detectDominantLanguage` to auto-detect the language.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
// Language Detection
const languageData = await comprehend.detectDominantLanguage({ Text: text }).promise();
const detectedLanguages = languageData.Languages;
const primaryLanguage = detectedLanguages[0].LanguageCode;
```

- Then use `primaryLanguage` as the `LanguageCode` in subsequent API calls.

#### **Entity Recognition**

- Recognize entities like names, places, organizations.

**Code Example:**

```javascript
const entitiesParams = {
    Text: text,
    LanguageCode: languageCode
};
const entitiesData = await comprehend.detectEntities(entitiesParams).promise();
const entities = entitiesData.Entities;
```

- Add `entities` to your response.

#### **Masking PII in Text**

            LanguageCode: languageCode
        };
        const piiData = await comprehend.detectPiiEntities(piiParams).promise();
        const piiEntities = piiData.Entities;

        // Mask PII in Text
        let anonymizedText = text;
        piiEntities.forEach(entity => {
            const beginOffset = entity.BeginOffset;
            const endOffset = entity.EndOffset;
