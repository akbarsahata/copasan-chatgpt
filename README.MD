# Copasan ChatGPT

Welcome to the **Copasan ChatGPT** repository!

This repository is a simple blog written with express.js and renders markdown files.

This blog contains my personal thoughts, opinions, and collection of my conversations with ChatGPT that I think will be useful to share and read later.

Feel free to explore and learn from here.
